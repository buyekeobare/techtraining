What is internet?
The internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of protocols.
Each computer connected to the Internet is assigned a unique IP address (Internet Protocol) that allows the device to be recognized. 
The DNS, Domain Name System is the phonebook of the internet. 
Web browsers interact through IP addreses, while DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load internt rsources.
